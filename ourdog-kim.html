      HELLO, I AM KIM

        Hi, I'm KIM! I just might be the friendliest, most outgoing and loyal puppy you'll ever meet. I'm not afraid of much; I pay attention and learn quickly; I walk proudly on my leash without too much fuss if my walker knows how to reign me in. They say my floppy ears bounce when I walk but I'm to busy enjoying to notice! I like to chill out with a toy or a chew in my crate or a cozy floor spot when my people are doing their thing. I really appreciate when they leave the door of my crate open so I can stroll in when I wanna hang in my "room. Sometimes I get a time out in there too, so I know I did something wrong if the door closes. If I feel guilty sometimes I beat them to it and put myself in a time out. It doesn't happen too often anymore as I'm really starting to learn right from wrong. With consistency I will become a very well behaved and joyful dog, which is good because my Foster Dad says I'll be a big boy when I'm grown! I haven't been around kids much but other than mouthing a little here and there (especially if I'm not scolded for it) I'm very gentle. My biggest weakness is my coyote impression. I like to practice it when I get crated for the night and Foster Parents tell me I shouldn't quit my day job of being a good boy for that silliness. I hope I can find a forever home where I have consistency & discipline, play time, good food, and possibly even jobs to do. I will make someone a good ol best friend one day. Thanks for taking the time to read about me!
