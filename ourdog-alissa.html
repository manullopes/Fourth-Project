        Hi! I am Alissa, or you can call me Ali if you'd like. I came into SCARS and I was terrified. I did not know where I was headed. I was unsure of going into the house and I was unsure of my new humans. However, I have come around. There is nothing I love most than cuddling with them and asking to be petted and loved. I will wake you up with my face nozzling into you and I will always be excited to see you. My foster brothers have taught me a lot! I have learned that I don't need to be afraid, and that I can actually be a happy dog and play. I feel spoiled! I have never felt this way, or had so much love before. I do like my space though and don't like to be stepped on. I let my foster brothers know that they are invading my space in a healthy manner. I am looking for a home that will cuddle with me all day every day. That is a must! I will also require a home with a male resident dog that will continue teaching me the ropes of how to be a dog. If you think I am a good fit for your family, please apply!!
